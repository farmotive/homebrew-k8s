# Homebrew farmotive k8s
This tap contains formulas for farmotive k8s utilities.

## Install
Use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager with one of the options below (in order of preference):
- Managed by [Brewfile](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle):
  ```sh
  tap 'homebrew/bundle'
  tap 'farmotive/k8s'
  brew '<formula>'
  ```
- Unmanaged CLI:
  ```sh
  brew tap farmotive/k8s && brew install <formula>
  ```
- If a formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can specify the full formula namespace:
  ```sh
  brew install farmotive/k8s/<formula>
  ```
- Or full formula URL:
  ```sh
  brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/farmotive/homebrew-k8s/master/Forumla/<formula>.rb
  ```
